<br>Never seek to tell thy love,<br>
<br>Love that never told shall be;<br>
<br>For the gentle wind does move<br>
<br>Silently, invisibly.<br>
<br>I told my love, I told my love,<br>
<br>I told her all my heart,<br>
<br>Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears.<br>
<br>Ah! she did depart!<br>
<br>Soon after she was gone from me,<br>
<br>A traveller came by,<br>
<br>Silently, invisibly:<br>
<br>He<br>
<br>took<br>
<br>her<br>
<br>with<br>
<br>a<br>
<br>sigh.<br>
