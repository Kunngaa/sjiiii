  <p class="a"><strong>Attend workshops by local authors.</strong></p><p> Check with your local bookstores or libraries to see if they </br> have any events planned for visiting poets. These usually include a reading by the poet and workshopping </br>your own poetry. Take advantage of these events so you can continue learning.</p>

  <p class="b"><strong>Take creative writing courses online or in school.</strong> </p><p>Look at your local university or community college to </br>find in-class options or see if online lectures are available. Creative writing covers many basics, like </br>short stories and poetry. See if there’s a class offered with poetry as its primary focus.</p>

  <p class="c"><strong>Consider getting an MFA in poetry.</strong></p><p>Getting your master’s degree will help expose you to more poetry</br>as well as help shape your own writing style. Your professors will help guide you and make you think</br>critically on what does and doesn’t work in poems.</p>
