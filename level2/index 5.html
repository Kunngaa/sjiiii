 <h1>Never seek to tell thy love<br></h1>
 <h2>Love that never told shall be<br></h2>
 <strong><h3>For the gentle wind does move<br></h3></strong>
 <center>Silently, invisibly<br></center>
 <strong><h4>I told my love, I told my love<br></h4></strong>
 <strong><h1>I told her all my heart<br></h1></strong>
 <center><h4>Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears<br></h4></center>
 <strong><h2>Ah! she did depart!<br></h2></strong>
 <h4>Soon after she was gone from me,</h4><br>
 <strong><h1>A traveller came by<br></h1></strong>
 <center>Silently, invisibly<br></center>
 <strong><h4>He took her with a sigh.<br></h4></strong>
