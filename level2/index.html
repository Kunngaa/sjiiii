 <title>Love's Secret</title>

 <p><strong>Never seek to tell thy love</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Love that never told shall be</strong></p>
 <p><strong>For the gentle wind does move</strong></p>
 <p>Silently, invisibly</p>
 <p><strong>I told my love, I told my love</strong></p>
 <p><strong>I told her all my heart</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Ah! she did depart!</strong></p>
 <p>Soon after she was gone from me,</p>
 <p><strong>A traveller came by</strong></p>
 <p>Silently, invisibly</p>
 <p><strong>He took her with a sigh.</strong></p>
