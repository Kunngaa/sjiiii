  <h1>Strudying Poetry</h1>
  <p><strong>Attend workshops by local authors.</strong> Check with your local bookstores or libraries to see if they </br> have any events planned for visiting poets. These usually include a reading by the poet and workshopping </br>your own poetry. Take advantage of these events so you can continue learning.</p>

 <ul>
  <li><em>See if your city or a city near you hosts a writer conference. There, you can meet other writers and </br>attend lecture sessions.</em></li>

  <p><strong>Take creative writing courses online or in school.</strong> Look at your local university or community college to </br>find in-class options or see if online lectures are available. Creative writing covers many basics, like </br>short stories and poetry. See if there’s a class offered with poetry as its primary focus.</p>
</div>
 <ul>
  <li><em>Search on YouTube or Vimeo for masterclasses or lectures from professional poets.</em></li>

  <p><strong>Consider getting an MFA in poetry.</strong>Getting your master’s degree will help expose you to more poetry</br>as well as help shape your own writing style. Your professors will help guide you and make you think</br>critically on what does and doesn’t work in poems.</p>
</div>
 <ul>
  <li><em>Many MFAs require you to have prerequisite courses or similar experience. Make sure you check</br> the school where you apply for information on what you need.</em></li>
  <li><em>Getting an MFA in poetry doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get a job as a professional poet.</em></li>
